Hello!

This website is the public face of an online community for game tools development. It was mainly born out of the [Game Developers Conference](https://gdconf.com){:target="_blank"} _Technical Issues in Tools_ roundtable sessions.

Part of the online community is also from the IGDA Tools SIG. That organization is dormant at the moment, but in the past they organized a lot of blog content. That content is archived here.
