    Process <br> Automated testing provides a team with more stable software at an earlier point in development, allowing easier scheduling and fast iteration. Yet investing in automated testing has a bad reputation in the industry, where just-ship-it is the mantra. Maybe, as increased budgets and team sizes make stability even harder, its time has finally come. <br>  <br> On Day 1 we prefer to discuss the people that write the tests and the workflows used to reinforce them. How does the process work in your studio? Are the engineers responsible for automated tests, or QA? Are QA silo'd or integrated? What could be better? What doesn't work? <br>  <br> These roundtables bring together people of all experience levels and budgets to discuss how they currently, or would like to, use automated testing of any form.

What are issues you have bumped into when implementing USD into your pipeline? <br> 2. What would be required for USD to be more widely adopted? <br> 3. How can studios, and vendors, best share Schemas? <br>  <br> Questions can be oriented towards technical issues, design, and artistic workflows.

    In 2023, there have been 'disruptions in The Force' around aggressive re-licensing in both the tabletop and digital realms from Hasbro and Unity, with both back-pedaling substantially on those efforts after user reaction to the changes. Hasbro ended up re licensing some aspects of their IP under Creative Commons and Unity brought in former Red Hat CEO and Open Organization author Jim Whitehurst as an interim CEO. In the meantime Godot, The Open 3D Engine and Blender have all seen growth in interest around their tools in part due to this turmoil. During this round table, the floor is opened for discussion around ways to better communicate, and ideally increase, the role of Open Technologies and practices within the Industry.

## UX

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    When we make game development tools it is very easy to pick what we think is a 'sensible default', and have all users deal with it. We think those defaults makes sense, and work for most users. However, even a cursory look at DCCs such as Unity, Unreal, 3dsMax, Maya, and Blender shows us that this is wrong. Unity, Max, and Maya have the hierarchy on the left side of the screen, while Unreal and Blender have the hierarchy on the right side of the screen. The same differences can be found between all of them when it comes to toolbars, the 3D view, the property panel, and the asset browser. There is no 'sensible default' for any of those panels in the UI, yet we often hear they 'should' be on the left or 'should' be on the right. <br>  <br> What do we have to unlearn, to improve the UX of our tools?

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    Every game editor needs a user interface. It is how we allow developers to create content for the game in a visual way. A good UI renderer has clear-cut constraints, like drawing nicely anti-aliased primitives, yet programmers have vastly different approaches to rendering game editor UI. <br>  <br> In this session, Wessel Mast, Tools Programmer at Guerrilla, will tell you about how Guerrilla's editor 'Decima' renders UI: how it uses a tile-based renderer, commonly used in light culling, SSAO, depth of field and more, for drawing complex UI in an efficient manner and how it manages to draw thousands of primitives like rectangles, lines and curves in a single draw call using signed distance fields.

<p class="tooltip__content">
    The New York City of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is roughly twice as large as that of earlier titles in the series. At the same time, new quality and performance constraints required the creation of additional distant city LODs. The manual distant-LOD geometry pipeline of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales was no longer viable. This lecture describes how Insomniac Games transitioned to automated distant-LOD geometry generation. In particular, it covers in-depth the applications of fundamental mesh analysis concepts (dual meshes, the Euler Characteristic, curvature estimation, etc...) to several difficult problems (beyond standard reduction and remeshing) that arise from the unique constraints regarding distant city LODs present in Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

    Requirements for game worlds are ever-increasing, being more realistic, more interactive, and larger than ever before. This means that there is a ton of content to be authored, but also large amounts of data to pass through pipelines and workflows to the engine runtime. Remedy has been working on a new data pipeline and technology stack for the Northlight engine that allows us to optimize entity data for authoring at edit time, and performance at runtime, while keeping near-instant iteration times for world editing workflows. The fundamental parts of this technology are OpenUSD for authoring, and Northlight's transformative live-edit pipeline that enables entity modifications to be applied to a running game process on the fly. In this presentation, Sebastian shares how we keep the editor and runtime data representations separated, how the data is transformed, and how the real-time editing between the editor and runtime works in practice.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    Continuous Integration (CI) is a common practice in modern software organizations. It plays an especially important role for AAA game development, where thousands of build jobs are submitted daily. However, the size and complexity of video games tend to inflate build size and duration, leading to a slower CI and longer feedback time. To provide faster CI feedback, studies have explored optimization techniques that can skip steps, and sometimes the entirety, of build jobs. This talk presents an overview of these techniques and highlights their costs and benefits. Then, it introduces RavenBuild Dev, a novel ML-based technique tailored for video games. Contrarily to existing approaches, RavenBuild predicts build outcomes for both code and data submissions, providing full coverage for a game development CI. RavenBuild skips passing builds and therefore reduces the CI cost, up to 43%, while ensuring that failing builds are properly anticipated.

They will learn how to control particle color and opacity, as well as how to fade out particles where they intersect with scene geometry. <br>  <br> Even more features can be added to provide more control, or removed to increase performance. Artists can have full control over a particle system they build themselves and Ben will show them how in this session.

    Generative AI is shaking up the industry, so like any other emerging technology we, as tech-artists, can ride the wave and bend our curious eye at its challenges, promises, and time saving nature. All to fold the best parts into our workflows, pipelines, and processes. <br>  <br> Daniel Ocean is an Associate TechArt Director at Ubisoft currently working on XDefiant â€“ a competitive arena shooting pulling from all the Ubisoft gaming franchises and engines, both old and new. <br>  <br> The session includes an evaluation of generative AI and its current place in production â€“ both generally and within Ubisoft. Daniel takes a look at the novel and different ways AI is, and will, solve pain points for artists and designers through examples. Additionally, we look practically at how to create training data for custom GenAI, image-based, tools using Houdini. With a focus on the importance of owning the input training for tools as much as the output of the generation.

    Marvels Spider-Man 2 employed over a dozen procedural systems in creation and population of its open world and many more in support of destruction, breakables, effects and characters. The power of procedural systems in production is widely recognized and it's hard to name a studio that isn't taking advantage of them. It allows efficient, rapid generation and iteration of a vast amount of content in game development. Unfortunately, the development of production ready procedural systems themselves can be far from an efficient process. This presentation uses successful and less than successful examples from Marvel's Spider-Man 2 production in a guide to development and implementation of procedural systems from inception.

<p class="tooltip__content">
    We present a novel neural material compression technique that is designed to take advantage of hardware accelerated texture compression formats. This approach leans on a multiresolution set of block compressed (BC6H) textures that is subsequently decoded by a small neural network. In practice, our method is integrated into the current pipelines in two stages. At production stage, we use deep learning to jointly learn the texture set and the decoder network. At runtime, we sample the learned textures and then reconstruct the material information by inferring neural network in a shader.

    'Streetball Allstar' is a 3v3 street basketball game that attracts players with its real-time competition and fairness. AI bots play an important role in the game. Firstly, they assist beginners in learning and improving, providing examples of exceptional skills and teamwork. Secondly, AI bots serve as teammates or opponents, increasing the diversity and competitiveness of the game. Most importantly, AI bots ensure fair competition, fill the gap when there are not enough players and match players of different tiers with highly customized parameters. In terms of training, we combine reinforcement learning and imitation learning, allowing AI bots to learn a wide range of strategies and simulate human thinking and behavior patterns, possessing human-like qualities and human-AI interaction while also having rich strategy diversity. Through dynamic difficulty control, we can control the operation level of the AI accurately and reasonably, adapting to different skill levels. With the client-side deployment solution, AI bots are decoupled from the core logic of game, improving response speed and ensuring data security. In our demonstration, AI bots have shown outstanding performance in various aspects such as difficulty switching, accurate response, strong adaptability, human-AI interaction, and high stability, receiving enthusiastic praise from both players and our customer.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    Naruto Mobile is a popular Fighting Game with over 100 million registered players. AI agents are deployed to the game for various applications such as level challenges. Although deep reinforcement learning is an excellent approach to creating agents with diverse strategies, it is difficult to apply to Naruto Mobile--a game that is built on a pool of 300 characters with unique skills. A traditional approach of self-play training at such a scale may require substantial training costs and time. This talk presents a new training approach to improve agents' generalization ability and optimize massive-scale self-play. The proposed algorithm has already been employed by Naruto Mobile to create agents, which have been used in more than 300 million human-AI fighting matches. To the best of our knowledge to date. This is the first time that deep reinforcement learning has been employed by a commercial fighting game.

    While we're flooded with generative AI approaches, we intend to show a different possibility to facilitate ML for better and faster gamedev: AI-assisted game design. AI-assisted development is barely emerging, usually as recommendations in programming IDEs. We tried a similar approach to build tools for game designers in three areas: level design, narrative, and game object design (game mechanics related). In this talk, we will show which areas benefited the most, with very promising ML recommendations to ease the designers' work, and what algorithms are showing the most promise despite being really low effort. We will share where, from our experience, ML will not deliver good results anytime soon and how we went from a hardly working system to what seems to be a promising tool.

    This presentation will introduce to you a character animation system using machine learning, dubbed MotorNerve, which implements two core character animation functions: locomotion control and transition animation generation. First, by combining Motion Matching and Learned Motion Matching technologies, MotorNerve achieves high-quality, low-consumption locomotion control while speeding up the tuning process for Learned Motion Matching. Secondly, MotorNerve also implements an inhouse Motion In-Betweening (MIB) algorithm, which uses a variational autoencoder to encode leg movements, significantly improving the foot skating problem of existing methods. This method, a joint work by Zhejiang University and TiMi Studio Group, a Tencent Games studio, has been published in SIGGRAPH 2022. MotorNerve applies MIB to interactive animation scenarios, generating high-quality transition animations while saving the project costs.

    The latest AI and LLM (Large Language Models) innovations have paved the way for completely re-imagining the game development process, driving the discovery of new games, and making safer gaming experiences. What was a weeks-long process of creating the first playable prototype can now be achieved within a day. We will explore how developers can leverage AI for everything from texturing 3D models to generating and debugging code and arranging 3D scenes. We will also explore how AI is being used at Roblox to help drive the discovery of new games and match players to the right content. And how AI is helping to create safer and more civil gaming experiences. Lastly, we will showcase how AI enables a new generation of User-Generated Content (UGC) with a conversational interface and how these capabilities will empower developers to make more engaging experiences where their users participate in the creation process.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    When authoring behavior for game AI we must reason about a broad range of systems and their associated data. Commonly, this reasoning is formulated by means of visual scripting languages and behavior trees (among others). These tools often introduce challenges for reusability, and managing data dependencies in complex worlds. <br>  <br> In this talk, Sam Fay-Hunt demonstrates a framework to modularize game AI concepts into compartmentalized, reusable components. This system is highly suited to reasoning about, and describing properties of, environments or situations. He describes the core pillars of its design, and how it can be used to augment existing behavior authoring systems to empower designers to incorporate powerful concepts such as quality, danger, or utility into decision making.

    Utility theory is a common method for handling decision making in games. Much has already been said about it, but most resources focus on theory rather than the nuts & bolts of actually building the system. This session solves that by focusing on implementation with only a light touch on theory. <br>  <br> The session starts by dissecting the architecture of a utility system, breaking down core concepts such as considerations, utility curves, and decision hierarchies. The session also examines the importance of data in tuning utility systems, offering insights into how designers manipulate data, curves, and more. Attendees discover essential tools for debugging utility systems and learn to navigate potential challenges and performance concerns. <br>  <br> The session concludes with a live demo, showing the full process of adding a new decision into the game, from design to implementation.

    In this two-part session, we will first present the latest enhancements in the Radeon Developer Tool Suite, a rich set of GPU profilers and analyzers and a recently-added GPU crash analysis tool. We will show how developers can use the tools to optimize game performance and get insights into how games are running on AMD Radeon GPUs. We will also present a completely redesigned Radeon Developer Panel and show how it can be used to quickly obtain the data to feed into the other tools in the suite. <br> Next, Miguel (Striking Distance Studios) will present GPU Reshape, a just-in-time instrumentation framework with instruction level validation of shader operations. We discuss the challenges with instrumenting across multiple intermediate representations, and how a unified model was achieved through a custom intermediate language featuring seamless bi-directional translation. We'll take a deep dive into current validation methodologies and what the future of instrumentation may look like.

    Building an award-winning game is complicated; your branching strategy shouldn't be. With projects spanning thousands-to-millions of files, limitations of your versioning system should not dictate how you set up your branches or make you think twice about implementing methodologies such as 'branch per bug.' Perforce Streams helps teams keep things simple, allowing you to design and automate development and release processesâ€¯inâ€¯Helix Core. In a recent survey, 73% of organizations agreed that Helix Core is best-in-class for visualizing your development workflow and preventing common issues like merge conflicts or broken builds.â€¯Streams easily organizes changes throughout your project's lifecycle, guiding teams through branching and merging with no external tools or scripts required.â€¯ In this talk, we'll introduce a new way to achieve lightweight branching via Sparse Streams. This latest feature in Helix Core will enable your team to branch smarter to build better games, significantly reducing the amount of metadata produced. With benefits like increased developer velocity and lower data storage requirements, Sparse Streams solves the need for lightweight branching for both development and release scenarios. Join Director of Product Management, Brent Schiestl and Senior Software Engineer, David Lewak as they demonstrate how lightweight branching can: -Save your team time and resources. -Significantly reduce the amount of data stored per branch. -Quickly add new branches without paying the metadata population cost.
