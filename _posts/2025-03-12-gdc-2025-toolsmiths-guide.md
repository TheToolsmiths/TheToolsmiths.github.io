<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    In game development, the focus of user experience often centers on the player experience, but the journey of creating it is just as crucial. Before a game reaches players, designers, developers, and artists must navigate tools and workflows that directly influence the quality of the final product. This talk explores the often-overlooked importance of internal UX in game creation, with insights drawn from the processes at CD PROJEKT RED. <br> Using examples of custom tools, such as Asset Hive, Anna demonstrates how optimizing tools and workflows at CD PROJEKT RED saves time, enhances collaboration, and fosters creativity. Participants will gain an understanding of the difference between merely unblocking issues and achieving true optimization. They will leave with actionable insights to immediately apply UX strategies to their own game development workflows, driving measurable improvements and supporting the excellence of their designs.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    All games contain scripted logic, yet not every developer has an affinity for code. A visual programming framework can unlock a world of productivity for a wide range of developers, if the user experience is smooth enough. It can be used by multiple engine systems and doesn't have to come at the cost of performance. <br>  <br> In this session, Bryan Keiren, Principal Game Tech Programmer at Guerrilla, will tell you about how a visual programming framework for audio scripting became a blueprint for visual programming in other subsystems of Guerrilla's DECIMA engine such as animation, game logic, and shaders. The audience will be guided through which features helped to achieve fast creation and iteration times, how it enables content creators to independently debug their content, how the framework has scaled to multiple engine systems, and how it supports developers of all disciplines to code without writing code.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    Spreadsheets! They're the most versatile tool in a game designer's palette, offering unmatched possibilities. In these microtalks, spreadsheet nerds will showcase their creations, sharing insights on their origins, workflow, design choices, and discoveries. <br>  <br> Lauren Scott shipped economy and progression systems for Psychonauts 2. She'll present the spreadsheet used to bring diverse levels to life under a shared progression scheme. <br>  <br> Guillaume Pierre created an economy spreadsheet for Cityscapes: Sim Builder, simulating time, space, money, and progression to balance landmark effects. <br>  <br> Nathan Harling used a spreadsheet to generate thousands of words of player-facing text, reducing errors and editing costs. <br>  <br> Tyler Coleman's team built game content in spreadsheets for Merchant Guilds, using Apps Scripts for direct deployment, making it a trusted source for live game content. <br>  <br> Russ Fan developed a level design tool within spreadsheets for Full Bloom, enabling quick iteration on hundreds of levels. <br>  <br> Tomo Moriwaki explored storytelling complexity with Epic Tavern, managing thousands of encounters and over 600 quests.

    A presentation from NetherRealm studios telling the development story of Mission Kontrol ‚Äì an Unreal Engine plugin for testing fighting game combat scenarios that has become an essential tool for hundreds of artists, engineers, QA testers, and designers. This is a high-level retrospective on the full process of problem identification, framework design, implementation, feedback, and live iteration alongside an evolving game project. <br>  <br> Every game studio discipline has a unique workflow and toolbox, but they all contribute to the same shared product. Ensuring the stability and quality of that product is a shared responsibility, so everybody needs to be able to test their work locally before submitting to a shared build. Especially when fixing bugs. This can be a significant challenge in a game with intricate controls, or for a hybrid remote workforce. Learn how NetherRealm addressed this problem with in-engine tooling, dramatically reducing bug-fixing and iteration times.

    At Electronic Arts before users submit content to Perforce they must run a pre-submission tool called CheckMate. This tool is used at almost every studio at EA and provides a consistent experience for everyone. The challenge being that no one studio or team works in the same way. In this presentation, we will go over the technical architecture of CheckMate and how it supported extensibility and leveraged inner-sourcing.

        Apex Legends' 26th Legend presented a significant technical challenge; one of her abilities allowed her to create portals through walls. However, in a competitive game where survival is the objective, there was zero tolerance for players getting out-of-bounds. This session delves not only into the details of how a navmesh based solution was created to solve this issue, but also how this allowed us to leverage navmesh to create a variety of systems, including an out-of-bounds exploit detection system and powerful procedural placement tools. This session then goes into the advantages of having each system use shared core tech in a slightly different way resulting in these features effectively providing testing for each other. Finally, this session discusses the novel web server based, in-game test framework we created to provide robust regression testing and automatic error reporting and how the combination of these systems allowed us to ship this Legend exploit free.

    File organization is an important part of every collaborative endeavor. In game development, file hierarchies need to change throughout production as experiments illuminate new goals and eliminate old ones. The ability to move, delete, and rename files without unpredictably breaking your game build is a key part of this process as the project scales in both manpower and content. However, we often have highly interconnected networks of files that reference other files‚Ä¶ which reference other files‚Ä¶ and so on. Reorganizing files in this context is not trivial and when done manually can cost significant time to do safely. <br>  <br> This talk discusses how Naughty Dog approaches the problem of moving and renaming source files. Our solution underscores our studio's value of experimentation throughout production and lays the foundation for a set of new asset management features that our TDs can use in their tools.

<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    The presentation introduces a post-processing outlining solution for real-time Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR). This method can be applied to all game scenes based on deferred rendering, and unique outlining effects can be added through this scheme. Inspired by the low-discrepancy sequences generated after TAA jitter on top of geometric information stored in GBuffer, this method resolves potential issues that may occur during the post-processing stage of the rendering pipeline through a denoising algorithm similar to ray tracing denoising. It successfully simulates a stable and realistic hand-drawn effect to enhance the artistic expression of the game graphics.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    Art workflows have become increasingly complex, and many areas of the production pipeline have not kept pace. Textures are a prime example, where the days of a single image applied to geometry are well over. We now have intertwined surface maps packed in various channels of multiple textures, causing headaches for all involved. EA Motive and SEED have decided to tackle this problem head-on and will present their learnings developing 'Texture Sets' for Dead Space, Iron Man, and more. Texture Sets is a modern rethink of the texture pipeline, bundling sets of related textures together into a single asset, and taking a data-driven and extensible approach to texture authoring, processing, and sampling.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
    In For Honor, AI bots are essential for maintaining consistent gameplay in both multiplayer and single-player modes. Traditionally, creating these bots is a labor-intensive process, taking around four weeks per hero to define unique behaviors and difficulty levels. Our challenge was to automate this process to keep up with the game's frequent updates. We utilized reinforcement learning (RL) and self-play techniques, allowing bots to train by playing against existing scripted bots and themselves. This method proved to be efficient in getting bots that are good enough to hold their own against players. To tailor difficulty, we developed an action masking system, giving designers control over the RL bots which is normally a frequent issue with this kind of tech. Additionally, we combined RL with traditional scripted logic, like behavior trees, to create hybrid bots that integrate seamlessly into all game scenarios. These bots have gone through extensive testing to make sure they are up to par with their scripted counterpart and have now shipped in the game. This presentation will share our automated bot creation process, which drastically reduced development time required to make bots. We will also cover how the For Honor production is switching over to this new system for the creation of bots for future heroes. We also aim to provide practical insights into how ML and traditional AI can be synergized to streamline game development.

    How are machine learning models and gen AI being used to power up Call of Duty development tools? The vast environments built for Call of Duty demand innovative solutions for managing an ever growing and extensive asset library. Multiple studios within Activision must efficiently find and retrieve 3D models, photogrammetry assets, animations, materials and more. Since traditional search methods, such as lexical string-matching, fail to capture the context of a query, handle synonyms and scale to manage an extensive asset library, Activision studios developed an AI-based semantic (multimodal) search engine that allows users to find and retrieve assets using natural language and images like concept art or reference pictures. Also, learn how large language models are incorporated into the studios' workflows to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to assist developers.

    Content generation systems for games are common, but tuning them is notoriously hard. Designers want to ensure a level of output diversity, but getting a useful view of the full range of content producible from a system is challenging. Such systems can produce uncountably large numbers of unique artefacts, each of which has to satisfy numerous constraints and subjective aesthetic goals. <br>  <br> This challenge of understanding the output range of a generative system is important for game designers, but it has also been a key concern for another group for the past two decades: Game AI researchers. Researchers need to directly compare novel generative systems to prior ones, and this has led to the development of alternative methods for describing and visualizing output diversity. In this talk, we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and how they could be used in your future development.

    When designing the card mini-game Kessel Sabacc for Star Wars Outlaws, one of the biggest challenges was to translate the fun of playing cards on a lively table to a PvE environment. Beyond making a ruleset fun and accessible, the high ambitions in immersion required the NPCs to express their frustration or their joy, just like any other gambler would do. This session explores how emotional behaviors were built for the Sabacc players NPC and the Canto Fathier Racing spectators NPC, two mini-games of Star Wars Outlaws. Inspired by classic human-computer interaction literature on emotional agents, the approach relies on the OCC model to better categorize and design a list of emotion assets, and a simplified Belief-Desire-Intention state machine to handle the logic of each emotional behavior.

    Massive worlds cause massive problems for NPC navigation. Pathfinding across large complex spaces can cause unwanted in-game stutters or blow memory budgets, while recreating navigation data and manually placing traversal annotations (such as jumps, vaults, and climbs) grinds iterating on content to a halt. <br> In this session, learn how Havok streamlined the creation of navigation data for massive worlds in Unreal Engine. Richard Kogelnig covers the tools and techniques used to get the most out of developer iteration time and runtime navigation performance. The talk goes into detail on how advanced navigation features, like traversal analysis, cluster graphs, and global region pruning, were integrated on top of Unreal Engine's suite of Editor tools.

<p class="tooltip__content">
    Generative AI is rapidly gaining popularity in the games industry, but beneath the hype lies a troubling reality. This technology, often built on uncredited and stolen work, is already being used to replace creative jobs and threatening the livelihoods of countless artists and developers. Beyond that, the massive environmental costs of maintaining AI infrastructure raise serious concerns about sustainability. This session will delve into the real, human dangers posed by generative AI, from its impact on the quality of creative work to the potential loss of genuine artistry in games. It will also discuss ways to eliminate some of these issues and how we can use the technology to enhance our workflows rather than replace them.

        The music that plays throughout most of COCOON is generated using 5 FMOD plugins, based on a handful of synthesis techniques including granular, subtractive, and FM/AM synthesis. These plugins run on all last- and current-generation consoles and on Windows. <br>  <br> Composer / programmer Jakob Schmid will explain the structure and operation of these instruments, how they are set up in FMOD Studio, and how they react to input from the game, focusing on a few experimentally developed control methods that might prove useful for any music software developer. <br>  <br> The plugins were developed experimentally using prototypes created in Bitwig's Grid mode and then reimplemented as FMOD Studio plugins in C++. This approach allowed rapid prototyping and effective implementation. A high level description of a few key components of the synthesizers is given, along with an explanation of how a graphical patch structure can be easily implemented in code.

    The challenge for any UGC platform is transforming players with no creation experience into content creators who can gradually progress and produce more high-quality content. Currently, 'Eggy Party' boasts over 100 million player-created mini-game, and over 26 million creators with the youngest being only five years old. We believe our key to success lies in resolving a contradiction: ensuring that the UGC tools are simple and easy to understand for beginners while also meeting the needs of professional creators for rich features and editing efficiency. Through user experience design, we provide a suitable editing experience for creators of varying skillsets and stages.

    Our players dedicate tens, hundreds, or even thousands of hours to the experiences that we craft for them. Players have valuable feedback about how we can improve those experiences, but it can be challenging for developers to quickly parse vast amounts of feedback and identify ways to improve experiences. The presenters will explore the benefits and risks of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing player feedback. LLMs offer a way to efficiently analyze feedback at depth and scale that has not been previously possible. However, there are dangers of producing incorrect outcomes that are easy to overlook without a careful approach. Prompt structure, game terminology, and data complexity can easily trip up LLMs. The session will present ways that Blizzard has been validating the use of LLMs for this type of analysis. We will illustrate workflows for using LLMs to enhance processes for analyzing feedback from players.
