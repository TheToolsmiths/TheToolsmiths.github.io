<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
Telemetry can be a game-changer in helping you develop better tools, but without watching users work, it can also be deeply misleading. <br>  <br> Using real-world examples, this talk offers practical and actionable advice on what telemetry can and cannot tell you, what to consider when adding a telemetry system to your tools, and how to use it to track improvements to the user experience of your tools over time.

Spreadsheets! Spreadsheets! Spreadsheets! (Now you can't say you haven't been warned) <br>  <br> In these microtalks, spreadsheet gurus will showcase their creations, sharing insights on their origins, workflow, design choices, and the discoveries they made along the way. <br>  <br> Mike Rossmassler will share his process for creating paper prototypes informed by spreadsheets. <br>  <br> Tyler Coleman will discuss how to combine Google Forms & Sheets to create mini paper prototypes using just sheets and survey forms, a low-code solution to test gameplay and UI <br>  <br> Everest Pipkin will discuss using spreadsheets to update websites in realtime, and how this can be utilized both for responsive, flexible webgame development as well as community-sourced solidarity work and resource-building. <br>  <br> Guillaume Pierre will talk about the economy spreadsheet he created for Targon Studios' indie coop horror game Darkwater, simulating every loot drop, every room, every outpost and every district the game procedurally generates. <br>  <br> Ridima Ramesh will share how she drew on the versatility of spreadsheets in the process of developing an immersive strategy simulation; initially to alleviate complexity in early playtesting, and eventually to guide the creation of a companion app that facilitated player decision-making. <br>  <br> Tomo Moriwaki will talk about collaborating on google sheets and how Epic Tavern built directly from the google sheets into the game's data. The spreadsheets were set up to organize the data, but we needed to devise a way to work together on the story of the game in a way that worked for the data but didn't make thinking about the story impossible. <br>  <br> Cheryl Platz will teach you a localization and prototyping magic trick that transforms your Figma files into any language you plug into Google Sheets while demonstrating how spreadsheets can play a role in building a stronger UX design to implementation process.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
This session will showcase how automating asset integration can enable control over the final mix early on in development. Trying to maintain a mix during a game's development is tedious and time consuming work and can be problematic during the final mix if not done correctly. For Ghost of Yotei, Sucker Punch's Audio team decided they would try to solve these problems by creating a tool called Sound Sensei, which would be responsible for maintaining proper asset standards while fitting seamlessly between asset rendering and implementation. We will go over how Sound Sensei works for setting up mix rules, as well as how those rules get automatically applied to the corresponding assets non-destructively, and how this allows for adjusting the mix at any point during development without needing to reopen a DAW.

Why can't we hear the right footsteps (or any footsteps) on the other client? Why is that ambient loop only broken after the 30th reload? <br>  <br> This session dives into the messy reality of debugging audio systems in video games, offering practical techniques for solving everything from bizarre one-off glitches to long-standing systemic issues. Through real-world examples and a few battle-tested war stories, the speakers will walk attendees through a toolkit of strategies, ranging from logs, profilers, and breakpoints to naming conventions, documentation habits, and better cross-team communication. <br>  <br> Whether you're deep in engine code or just trying to figure out why your event isn't triggering, this talk aims to demystify the debugging process, helping developers build a more methodical, reliable, and less painful approach to tracking down audio bugs. <br>  <br> Attendees will walk away with practical strategies for identifying, diagnosing, and fixing audio bugs in real-time game systems. Through real-world examples and hands-on workflows, they'll pick up tools and habits to debug more efficiently, communicate better across teams, and ship more stable, polished audio without the guesswork.

Day 1: Process
Automated testing provides a team with stability across development, allowing early feedback, fast iteration and empowering QA. Yet investing in automation has a bad reputation in the industry, where just-ship-it is the mantra. Maybe, as the market becomes increasingly competitive, its time has finally come. <br>  <br> Day 1 consists of a discussion about the people that write the tests and the workflows used to reinforce them. How does the process work in your studio? Are the engineers responsible for automated tests, or QA? Are QA silo'd or integrated? What could be better? What doesn't work? <br>  <br> These roundtables bring people together from all experience levels and budgets to discuss how they currently, or would like to, use automated testing of any form.

Come and meet, discuss, and find out what everyone has been doing with USD. <br>  <br> Questions can be submitted during the roundtable. For example, these may include topics such as:
1. What are issues you have bumped into when implementing USD into your pipeline?
2. What would be required for USD to be more widely adopted?
3. How can studios, and vendors, best share Schemas? <br>  <br> Questions can be oriented towards technical issues, design, and artistic workflows, with day 1 having a larger focus on artistic workflows, and day 2 having a larger focus on technical issues.

Owlcat Games is famous for making sprawling RPGs with tons of player choice and reactivity. Such games often have hundreds or even thousands of individual variables to represent current narrative state: quests, previous decisions, etc. Essentially a bunch of global variables managed with ad-hoc logic. <br>  <br> This approach scales poorly, and so we designed a better system, which organizes game state into a hierarchy of sub-states that are automatically turned on and off while taking into account potential conflicts. <br>  <br> This talk will share the experience of building and using this 'Etude'-based system, and show examples of using it in both Unity and Unreal engines.

Before Sucker Punch had even finished shipping our previous game, Ghost of Tsushima, we knew we desperately needed to improve our writing processes for the next project. Integrating scripts required massive amounts of manual busywork, and writers had little context on how their work would actually be used in the game. So for Ghost of Yōtei, we took a big swing and decided to build a new tool from scratch which let writers write their scripts directly into mission rigging - hoping this could eliminate the busywork and get writers more closely integrated into the design process. As it turned out, not only did it end up massively helping both writers and designers, but the tool quickly expanded to help manage recording, auditing, script reviewing, and localization. So come learn what we did and why it worked, as well as where we stumbled along the way and what we learned from it.

Driven by the demand for immersive and visually stunning experiences, developers face the challenge of creating detailed assets efficiently and cost-effectively across multiple platforms. Traditional asset creation methods are time-consuming and expensive, making them inadequate for this evolving landscape. <br>  <br> This presentation explores how AI techniques, such as differentiable rendering and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), enhance asset production quality and efficiency. Specifically, within our game Honor Of Kings and other titles, we utilize Differential Shading Language (Slang) for material fitting, optimizing textures for low-end devices, and incorporating tools for artists to swiftly iterate designs. Innovations in geometry processing, including Software Occlusion Culling and Level of Detail (LOD) simplification, leverage rendering loss and visual importance to maintain high-quality visual experiences while reducing resource consumption. <br>  <br> By adopting these cutting-edge AI technologies, we significantly improve the creation and deployment of game assets, addressing the diverse challenges of modern game development.

<p class="tooltip__content">
At Ubisoft, knowledge is scattered across Confluence, Jira, GitLab, video platforms, and dozens of team silos. This fragmentation makes it harder to ramp up, debug, plan, or even stay aligned. So we built DocGPT: an internal, production-grade assistant designed to help teams search, understand, and reuse Ubisoft's knowledge using natural language.
Our goal was simple: reduce context switching and make internal knowledge more accessible. We co-developed our tech with production teams. Then it scaled. Fast!
Today, DocGPT supports workflows across multiple Ubisoft productions. It helps testers generate test cases from Design docs. It assists new developers with step-by-step guidance or by explaining custom pipeline code. It even supports managers by surfacing project status and Jira insights in plain English.
In this talk we'll share honest lessons from our rollout — from organizational acrobatics to surprising wins that reshaped our roadmap.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
In this talk, we will explore the integration of a designer-first reinforcement learning approach into EA SPORTS FC 26. The approach focuses on creating human-like AI behaviors for the game's goalkeeper. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods that demand extensive resources and time, our new approach enables game developers to train AI agents overnight. This talk will highlight how we address common issues when applying reinforcement learning to game production, such as fixing undesired behaviors, and how to build a robust testing system featuring over 300 'unit-test' scenarios, ensuring continuous validation. Our new goalkeeper AI not only outperforms the legacy game's built-in AI with a 10% improvement in ball saving rate, but trains 50% faster than standard reinforcement learning methods, while being less robotic than other DRL or traditional AI approaches. During the talk we will show several videos comparing the performance of the goalkeeper trained with reinforcement learning and the old game's CPU AI. The videos will also showcase the difference in quality between the two approaches, demonstrating that our approach produces more human-like behavior. By sharing these insights, we aim to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be successfully applied in video game production for player-facing gameplay to create realistic and engaging AI, targeting developers' needs.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
This session presents a production-proven Neural Simulation system for skeletal physics, as seen on dozens of characters in the action game FateTrigger. The presenters explain how they overcame the notorious performance bottleneck of real-time secondary physics simulations (hair, cloth, accessories) for a large cast of characters. Their deep learning solution delivers high-fidelity, stable physics for a fraction of the cost—just 0.02-0.13ms on a single CPU core—making complex simulations viable while maintaining smooth, high-framerate gameplay. The talk explores the entire production pipeline, from its meticulously designed network architecture with quantization-aware training, to its high-performance custom C++ inference engine and a dynamic, load-balanced LOD system. It demonstrates that neural physics is no longer a research concept but a powerful solution for achieving superior performance while scaling to a higher volume of dynamic character simulations.

<p class="tooltip__content">
This talk explores the technical and creative processes behind the music of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, where I served as a music programmer, and soundtrack contributor. Using our proprietary Sequence Music Engine and music logic module, we authentically scored the game's 1400s Bohemia setting with segment-based adaptive music driven by in-game variables. Our workflow centers around the notation program Sibelius and our custom tool Converdi, which streamlines the production by converting the score symbols to preliminary MIDI streams per individual VSTs and by extracting the precise timing data necessary for the segment transitions. This enabled us to spend more time on the creative aspects of music and less time on production and implementation.

<div class="tooltip">
<i class="tooltip__icon">i</i>
<p class="tooltip__content">
AI is an incredible accelerant for early-stage creativity. It excels at rapid prototyping, sketching concepts, exploring level layouts, generating quest variants, and helping engineers debug. But when it comes to a game's final creative expression—the characters players bond with, the stories that move them, the art that defines a world, and the music that anchors emotion—the work must remain unmistakably human. Anything less flirts with plagiarism. <br>  <br> Mark Long and Don Norbury outline how VILLAIN Studio applies 'responsible AI' on their upcoming title FRONTIER, using automation as a force multiplier while preserving the integrity of human authorship. Their framework blends ethical guardrails, transparent pipelines, and creative oversight to ensure AI supports developers without replacing them. The result is a production model that protects originality, empowers artists, and uses AI where it's strongest: speeding iteration so teams can create better, faster, and more boldly.

<div class="tooltip">

<p class="tooltip__content">
Traditionally, prototyping has been a filtering process. Designers pitch ideas, developers evaluate feasibility, and only a handful make it to playable form. The rest? Shelved because there isn't time. At the same time, developers spend time building prototypes that never make it to production instead of focusing on the architecture, systems and polish required to ship. <br>  <br> This session explores how teams use tools like Bezi to change that dynamic. By removing technical bottlenecks, designers can translate ideas directly into playable mechanics in minutes, not days. Designers get creative freedom. Developers get to focus on production-quality work. More experimentation, more creative exploration, better games.
