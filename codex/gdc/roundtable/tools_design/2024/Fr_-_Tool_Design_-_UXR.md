Fr - Tool Design - UXR

- Who is doing the user research on your tools at your studio, how big is that team? And quirks or complexities? External consultancy.

Wins:
[Large studio] Made a reference checker that was really valued.
[Large studio] Snowdrop engine, we have started to integrate indepth geometry
[Large studio] Consumer sentiment score came in today
[Sr Researcher, consultancy] We use Dovetail for the bulk of our analysis. Love the tags and total number of tags. Insights + clips are all great. 
[] We've been doing metrics. Looking at sensible defaults.

Worst:
[] Our old users did not migrate to the new tool and hated the new tool. 
[] We started getting more adhoc tools from nowhere that aren't maintained. It's a tough balance to ask people to standardize. Limiting what we actually want to have. 
[Large studio] NPS score has been quite low. It's hard to use when you only have 5 answers. Curious about Netpromoter score. 
[Large studio] Our users told me that our engine -- people prefer Unity or Unreal tools and ask people to just copy those tools.

[] Resources for programmers doing UX Design and programmer art.

How to actually get people to accept change? We've put effort and people ask to skin it like the old one.

Metrics for minimizing friction in a switchover of tools.

[Large studio] How do you organize the information to make sure it doesn't get lost in the abyss

[Startup] We have no UX. How do you build a culture?

Tools for user research
- Survey Monkey
- Mindmap manager
- Moray by the people using Snagit -- to flag an important moment, but it didn't scale up
- Miro + Team's recording

Unmoderated research tools

Metrics
- CSAT
- HEART framework by Google - more about delighting -- CASTLE by NNGroup - more about productivity 

[Large studio] Get early adopters. 
[Large studio] Artists refused to move off scale form and to photoshop and they refused. We had to use bribery, when we make "into game time" 2 minutes, then they said that want that.
[] Solve your problems, and get users involved in that solution as your champion.
[] Get people involved at all stages
[] We did a 30 day challenge - we were available for 30 days with a specific event
[] We rebuilt our world editor -- people wanted the old thing to work like the old tools and other tools and people didn't understand the thing. We had power users with UX designers working together to iterate. You can't make everyone happy.
[] We'd use the same menu to launch the tools to ask people which version they wanted. Then, do telemetry to see who clicked slowly and why? Used a time bomb to force a new tool.

Collating research
[] Linking the relevant documentation inside the comments of the code of the tool itself. Bugs, request, and research that goes with it.


Culture of design

Lots of tools by programmers, for programmers, used by artists.
[Large studio] We had to have frank conversations about the value of UX.
