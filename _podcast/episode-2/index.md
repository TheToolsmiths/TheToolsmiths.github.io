After a slight delay (Ahem, GDC :P), David and I are finally back with our second episode! This episode we chat with Jason Parks owner of Continuity AI. Jason is a long time technical artist with experience in console games and motion capture from THQ, Volition, Unity, SOE, and SCEA. Jason has such a rich past we pretty much trace through his accomplishments and pick up some topics along the way.

We are light on show notes this time around, so just enjoy the show!
