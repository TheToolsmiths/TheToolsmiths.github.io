This time around we chat with Philip Bloom, a senior tools engineer at Crystal Dynamics. He shares some information about some cool asset pipeline tools they are working on over there. Oh, we also hit upon revision control and continuous integration a bit along the way.

Introduction
Revision Control
Continuous integration solutions, amber
Sharebuild, sideband sharing
Languages and Frameworks used for tools development
Curating tech artist tools (alongside engineered tools, checked in as assets?)
All in all, our best episode yet, so give it a listen!
