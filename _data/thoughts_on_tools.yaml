  text : Evolution of software and interactions is like the natural evolution. If an interaction is difficult to use that software might not have as much success being adapted and being used by people and so it dies off. On the other hand, simple interactions from successful software will be used and evolved further.

  text : "When designing some feature (especially one with UI), I find that these can be useful questions to be asking: What widely-used software already does this kind of thing? What software does it really well? What does the state of the art look like?"

  text : "You need to build a system three times
- the first time you don't know what you actually need, it's an exploration, plan to throw it away
- the second time you think you know what you need so you over-architect, it'll be too restrictive, plan to throw it away
- the third time you build what actually works"
