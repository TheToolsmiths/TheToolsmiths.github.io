#### What is it?
It is not easy to find time/motivation to watch good GDC Vault videos. The Toolsmiths community decided to form a sort of "book club" for GDC Vault Talks (or other Game Tools related talks) called "Vault Club".

<hr>

#### How does it work?
We pick a video that is related to Game Dev Tools & Technologies, pick a date to watch it together or watch it on our own time, then discuss it in the [#vault-club channel](https://discord.gg/k4PuzbZ).

### Next Vault Club Screening TBD
